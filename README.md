# Bubbletea: Your Chatbot's Frontend

## What is Bubbletea?
Bubbletea is the fastest way to get your chatbot in front of users.

If you’ve already built a chatbot backend — using OpenAI, LangChain, or your own custom logic — Bubbletea gives you a hosted chat interface in seconds. Just provide your bot’s name and API endpoint, and Bubbletea generates a clean, mobile-friendly chat page you can share instantly.

Think of it like Webflow for chatbots — no frontend code, no deployment, no hassle.

## Why use Bubbletea?
🛠 No front-end needed – Build your bot in Python (or any language), plug it in, and you’re live.

⚡️ Instantly shareable – Each bot gets its own unique URL.

💬 Flexible output – Supports plain text, markdown, images, and more.

🧑‍💻 Developer-friendly – Simple API spec, works with any backend, integrates with your tools.

🧼 Clean UX – Polished UI optimized for both desktop and mobile.
